ActionController::UnknownFormat (PagesController#past is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

In light of yesterday’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, I’m republishing this (and jumping back on my sabbatical).*\r\n\r\nI am a bit of a news junkie in that I find myself checking news sites probably a dozen times a day. It’s part habit, part entertainment and part curiosity. But more and more I find myself annoyed and really kind of disgusted with traditional media.\r\n\r\nBack in 2013, The Guardian (surprisingly) published [*News is bad for you — and giving up reading it will make you happier](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli)* and it really snapped a lot of things in to perspective for me. Things that, upon reading the article, seemed obvious but just hadn’t clicked before.\r\n\r\nThere are two things that really bother me about my little news addiction…enough so that I feel I need to take some time off from consuming it, possibly permanently.\r\n\r\n### It’s desensitizing\r\n\r\nWhen the news started spreading about the San Bernardino shootings, I immediately started checking as many news sources as I could. Feverishly refreshing pages trying to get the latest information. Looking for photos and videos to try and piece together what happened.\r\n\r\nBut not once did I have a sinking feeling in my stomach. Not once did my mind go to all the people who were injured or killed and wonder what they and their families might be going through and how I could help. I just wanted more information and “the story.”\r\n\r\n**I’m desensitized to many of the highs and lows of humanity because I consume so much of it in the context of emotionless news articles.**\r\n\r\nAnd that scares me.\r\n\r\n### It’s unbalanced and misleading\r\n\r\nThere are so many things the news never covers. Not because they don’t have the resources to cover it, but because they don’t have any reason to. Certain types of stories simply get better ratings than others, and I can’t blame them. News outlets are businesses. They will always be biased towards whatever makes them the most money.\r\n\r\nBut consuming biased sources makes you, wait for it…*biased*.\r\n\r\nIt notoriously highlights the negative and buries the positive. The negative and the dramatic are far more entertaining because it makes it easy for us to think “I’m glad that’s not me.”\r\n\r\nBut even in grossly over emphasizing the negative, news outlets bury or never cover some of the most epic failures of humanity.\r\n\r\nTwo people dying from the bird flu can set off a worldwide panic, but the fact that 2.5 million people (over half of which are children) die every year from diarrhea…who cares. It’s old news. And nobody wants to read articles about diarrhea anyways.\r\n\r\nOr what about human trafficking? 27 million people are being bought, sold and traded like baseball cards. But that’s depressing. And I don’t know any slaves, so what does it matter?\r\n\r\nOrphans? 150 million.\r\n\r\nLack of clean water? 800 million.\r\n\r\nBut all of these stories get relegated to random “specials” on Dateline or 60 Minutes once a year.\r\n\r\nThese are issues that, as the richest country on earth, we could literally end *now*, but the media chooses to use their platform to talk about things that are largely irrelevant and unactionable to us.\r\n\r\nSo, I need make my move to fix that. I need to spend time resensitizing myself. I need to spend time finding out ways I can actually do something about global issues affecting humanity. And right now, ending my consumption of traditional news is the first step towards that.", "publish_at"=>"December 03, 2015 14:37"}, "return_to"=>"http://localhost:3000/admin/article", "_add_edit"=>"", "model_name"=>"article"}

Feverishly refreshing pages trying to get the latest information. Looking for photos and videos to try and piece together what happened.\r\n\r\nBut not once did I have a sinking feeling in my stomach. Not once did my mind go to all the people who were injured or killed and wonder what they and their families might be going through and how I could help. I just wanted more information and “the story.”\r\n\r\n**I’m desensitized to many of the highs and lows of humanity because I consume so much of it in the context of emotionless news articles.**\r\n\r\nAnd that scares me.\r\n\r\n### It’s unbalanced and misleading\r\n\r\nThere are so many things the news never covers. Not because they don’t have the resources to cover it, but because they don’t have any reason to. Certain types of stories simply get better ratings than others, and I can’t blame them. News outlets are businesses. They will always be biased towards whatever makes them the most money.\r\n\r\nBut consuming biased sources makes you, wait for it…*biased*.\r\n\r\nIt notoriously highlights the negative and buries the positive. The negative and the dramatic are far more entertaining because it makes it easy for us to think “I’m glad that’s not me.”\r\n\r\nBut even in grossly over emphasizing the negative, news outlets bury or never cover some of the most epic failures of humanity.\r\n\r\nTwo people dying from the bird flu can set off a worldwide panic, but the fact that 2.5 million people (over half of which are children) die every year from diarrhea…who cares. It’s old news. And nobody wants to read articles about diarrhea anyways.\r\n\r\nOr what about human trafficking? 27 million people are being bought, sold and traded like baseball cards. But that’s depressing. And I don’t know any slaves, so what does it matter?\r\n\r\nOrphans? 150 million.\r\n\r\nLack of clean water? 800 million.\r\n\r\nBut all of these stories get relegated to random “specials” on Dateline or 60 Minutes once a year.\r\n\r\nThese are issues that, as the richest country on earth, we could literally end *now*, but the media chooses to use their platform to talk about things that are largely irrelevant and unactionable to us.\r\n\r\nSo, I need make my move to fix that. I need to spend time resensitizing myself. I need to spend time finding out ways I can actually do something about global issues affecting humanity. And right now, ending my consumption of traditional news is the first step towards that."], ["publish_at", "2015-12-03 14:39:00"], ["created_at", "2019-02-10 20:40:05.331321"], ["updated_at", "2019-02-10 20:40:05.331321"]]
