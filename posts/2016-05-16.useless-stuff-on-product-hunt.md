  title: Maybe all that “useless” stuff on Product Hunt serves a higher purpose?
---

In the past I’ve been critical of the endless stream of seemingly “useless” stuff on Product Hunt, but I’m stopping that now. Props to the folks who actually ship stuff. It’s a heck of a lot more than most people ever do.

**The last thing you need is me or anyone else telling you it’s stupid.**

I’ve been creating junk on the web for 12+ years and 90% of it has been dumb. But they’ve *all* been stepping stones to better things.

Of course the world doesn’t need another todo or note-taking app, but the world **does** need more makers & people who aren’t afraid to try.

Yes, critique is a necessary part of the refining process, but almost no feedback on the web is constructive, nor is it even qualified. You and I don’t know the motivation or goals of the maker, and until we do, our feedback isn’t useful.

Simply not becoming a paying customer or not using the service is some of the strongest feedback a maker can get. It’s up to them to seek on why. It’s up to us to give feedback when it’s requested.

**Unsolicited feedback is almost never contextually relevant or useful.**
