title: Gratitude, empathy, relationships & hobbies
---

Whenever I hear the word “goals” I cringe a bit. I get the idea, it makes perfect sense to know what you want to achieve and then figure out the steps to get there. I just find life isn’t that simple. There are just too many variables for my brain to jump on that train.

That’s not to say I don’t have things I _want_ out of life and business, but instead of having yearly goals, I find it more beneficial to focus on intentional improvements to a few core things. Basically, make sure the ship is pointed in the right direction and then figure things out as I go.

So, for 2017, these are the three areas of my life I plan on actively improving.

### Gratitude & empathy

If I let myself, I can get cynical quickly. I don’t think I’m _outwardly_ all that cynical, and I’m generally a really optimistic person. But I can certainly _mentally_ be cynical. I’m finding I just don’t like how that influences the words I say, the thoughts I think and the way I treat people.

Instead, I want to actively have gratitude in every situation I can and look for the good in everything.

I also want to be really intentional about putting myself in other’s shoes…to understand their perspective, to learn about their struggles and to celebrate in their joys and comfort in sorrow.

### Relationships

To put it bluntly, I think I’m probably a pretty crappy friend. I don’t think I take advantage of others…the opposite really. I can get so laser focused on certain things in life that I just completely forget about a lot of friends.

I can come up with all sorts of excuses (“I’ve got a company to run!”, “I’ve got like 47 kids!”), but honestly, at the end of the day, I’m just really terrible at maintaining friendships.

### Hobbies

I’ve always tried to have a random hobby, but about a year ago I got _deep_ in to [hobby electronics](https://medium.com/@shpigford/how-to-take-up-hobby-electronics-ae2a39fae765#.qgp2z6ufu). Like…turn-a-room-of-our-house-into-a-makerspace deep.

It’s been so rewarding and fulfilling in every way. So, I plan to hobby the freaking crap out of 2017.

Three specific hobbies I’m choosing to persue: electronics, data science/machine learning and [handmade goods](https://cedarandsail.com).

Maybe these are “goals” or “resolutions”…I don’t know. It’s all semantics, I guess. But that’s what I’m focusing on for 2017.
