<h1>What I'm working on now</h1>
<p>I've always got a number of things I'm dabbling in, but my primary focus is getting <a href="https://maybe.co">Maybe</a> off the ground.</p>

<h3>Active projects</h3>

<div class="projects">
  <h4><a href="https://maybe.co">Maybe</a></h4>
  <p>In 2021 I founded Maybe to help folks take control of their financial future with modern financial planning and wealth management tools.</p>
  <h4><a href="https://lasertweets.co">Laser Tweets</a></h4>
  <p>I got a <a href="https://glowforge.us/JTTLXZSA">Glowforge</a> and started brainstorming fun things to do with it. You send in your favorite tweets, and I laser etch them on wood...because of course you need it.</p>
