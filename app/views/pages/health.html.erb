<h2>Health</h2>
<p>In 2019 I'm laser focused on living a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle. I've always struggled with getting regular exercise as well as having a healthy weight.</p>
<p>I trained for and ran a marathon on April 28 and now I'm working on losing 50 pounds. 🎉</p>

<h3>Weight Loss</h3>
<p>As of January 1, 2019, I'm 231 pounds with 30% body fat. At 6' 1", those numbers mean I'm considered obese.</p> 

<p>I'm following the slow carb diet (<a href="https://tim.blog/2012/07/12/how-to-lose-100-pounds/">as popularized by Tim Ferris</a>) and my goal weight is 180 pounds with 20% body fat.</p>

<h3>Marathon</h3>
<p>On April 28, 2019, I <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2326490991">ran a marathon</a>! It was brutal, but I'm really proud of myself for completing it.</p>
