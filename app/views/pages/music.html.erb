<h1>Music</h1>
<p>I'm an obsessive music listener and have been my whole life. I won't say I'm a music snob, but let's be honest, 95% of popular music these days is categerically some of the worst music ever created, but I digress 👴🏻.</p>
<p>You can follow along with what I'm listening to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/shpigford">on Spotify</a>.</p>

<h3>Lists</h3>
<p>The lists below aren't about ranking the music as much as me curating music around a given variable (time, location, mood, function, etc).</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/music/2019">Top Albums of 2019</a></li>
  <li><a href="/music/2018">Top Albums of 2018</a></li>
</ul>
