<h1>Designer Toys</h1>
<p>I started collecting designer toys back in 2004. Eventually, my little hobby turned into an <a href="https://joshpigford.com/projects/fugitive-toys">actual toy store</a> that my wife and I started in 2006, and then sold in 2009. My collection isn't quite what it was back then, but in the past few years I've started actively collecting again. This is a place for me to show off that collection!</p>
